John Walker's moontool.c astronomical calculation routines, extracted.

## Original

The original versions, [moontool](https://www.fourmilab.ch/moontool/)
and [moontoolw](https://www.fourmilab.ch/moontoolw/), are available at
John Walker's [fourmilab.ch](https://www.fourmilab.ch/).

## License

Walker's program is in the public domain, and so is this project.

In Walker's words:

> Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the law.

## Usage

To use the astronomical calculation routines, include `moon.h` and link
against C's standard math library (`-lm`).

It is C code, but can be used as-is in C++ projects[^1].

If in doubt, take a look at how the CLI is built in the
[`Makefile`](./Makefile).

[^1]:
    A C++ version of the CLI is available at
    [2df0bde](https://github.com/qrichert/moontool/blob/2df0bdef6d898bff955ea360075c20900af4c025/main.cpp).

## CLI

This version includes functions that print out info about the Moon, in a
way similar to the original program.

The CLI wraps these functions.

Run `make` and execute the resulting `moontool` program in the `build/`
directory.

You can run it bare for real-time data, pass it a datetime string or a
Unix timestamp (negative values allowed).

Use `-h` option for help.

To install it, run `make && sudo make install`.
