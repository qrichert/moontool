What good is a Sun without a Moon?  This version of Moontool  includes
versions  for SunView (moontool) and for OpenWindows (xmoontool).  The
OpenWindows version should be portable to any platform  that  supports
OLIT   3.0,  but  as  of  this  writing  I've  only  tested  it  on  a
SparcStation.

Moontool was designed and implemented by:

    John Walker

Major enhancements were made by Ron Hitchens:

    ronbo@vixen.uucp
    ...!uunet!cs.utah.edu!caeco!vixen!ronbo
    hitchens@cs.utexas.edu

John Walker created the initial OpenWindows version of Moontool.

enhancements,  which  I'll  incorporate  in  future  versions  of  the
